# Phaser 3 JRPG Demo

**Extremely incomplete.**

A game, built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3), which plays like a
classic JRPG.

This game was built to teach myself Phaser 3. It has all the basic elements of
a classic JRPG (I was namely inspired by Dragon Warrior/Quest). It is very
short. You play as the heroine Fae who must save her partner, the princess.

## Running

Right now I just use `python3 -m http.server` and open
http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html in Firefox for Ubuntu.

## Resources

I started building this game according to ["Modular Game Worlds In Phaser 3" by Michael Hadley](https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6). It helped a lot with figuring out [Tiled map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) integration.
